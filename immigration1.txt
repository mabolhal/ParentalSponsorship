Ottawa, December 30, 2019 —To ensure that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has sufficient time to complete the development of a new intake process for the 2020 Parents and Grandparents Program, the reopening of the program will be postponed until Ministerial Instructions are issued.
This means that the opportunity to express interest in sponsoring a parent or grandparent will not take place on January 1, 2020. Further information about the expected launch date and 2020 intake process will be available in the new year.
This will give all interested sponsors the same opportunity to submit an interest to sponsor form and a fair chance to be invited to apply.
We encourage all interested potential sponsors and stakeholders to stay up to date on the next Parents and Grandparents Program intake process by visiting IRCC’s website and social media channels:
